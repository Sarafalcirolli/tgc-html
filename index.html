            <p><b>Why I've decide to learn Coding?</b></p>
            <p>Since I realized the transformative impact of code,
            I've been fascinated by its ability to bring ideas to life 
            and contribute positively to society, all while enjoying 
            the freedom to explore this digital universe from anywhere 
            in the world.</p>

            <p>
                As a full-stack web development student at The Growth Company,
                my goals include mastering basic technologies like HTML, CSS, 
                and JavaScript to create engaging user interfaces. 
                I'm deepening my knowledge in front-end frameworks like React 
                and improving back-end development skills using languages like
                Node.js. Database management with MySQL and MongoDB is 
                the focus, ensuring efficient data handling. Through practical 
                projects, I will apply my theoretical knowledge in real-world 
                scenarios. Continuous learning will keep me up to date on 
                industry trends, while a curated online portfolio will showcase 
                my skills and projects, preparing me for a successful career in 
                web development.</p>
